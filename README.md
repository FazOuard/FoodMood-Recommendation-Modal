# FoodMood Recommendation Modal

This repository is dedicated to the **hybrid recommendation module** in the **FoodMood** application.  
It is built using the **Flask** backend framework and relies on three datasets:  

- **`Preferences_utilisateur`**: A private dataset created by the **FoodMood** team, based on real user preferences.  
- **`Plat`**: Contains information about various meals.  
- **`Historique`**: Stores users' interaction history.  

## Hybrid Recommendation Model

The hybrid recommendation model is based on two approaches:  

1. **Content-Based Recommendation Model**  
2. **User Preferences Recommendation Model**  

### Unique Feature  
Unlike traditional recommendation systems, this model **takes users' history into consideration** to provide more personalized and accurate suggestions.
